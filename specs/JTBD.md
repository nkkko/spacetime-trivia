### How to Use This JTBD Set

1. **Design Validation** – Ensure every UI element maps back to at least one job.
2. **Sprint Planning** – Pull jobs as epics; each must have metrics wired in analytics.
3. **Prioritisation** – J‑1 → J‑4 are MVP‑critical; J‑8 + J‑10 are stretch‑goals.
4. **Testing** – Craft usability tests that mimic the *When* conditions verbatim.

By anchoring features to these jobs, we guarantee development effort translates to real player value and measurable fun.
