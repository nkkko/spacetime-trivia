      When creating new MDC rules:

      1. Location Requirements:
         ```
         .cursor/rules/            # All rules must be here
         ├── your-rule-name.mdc    # One rule per file
         └── another-rule.mdc      # Separate files for each rule
         ```

      2. File Naming Convention:
         - Use kebab-case: example-rule-name.mdc
         - Make names descriptive and specific
         - Always use .mdc extension
         - One rule per file

      3. Basic Rule Structure:
         ```
         # Rule Title

         Brief description of the rule's purpose

         <rule>
         name: rule_name
         description: Detailed description
         filters:
           - type: [event|content|file_extension]
             pattern: "your_pattern"
         actions:
           - type: [suggest|reject]
             message: "Your message"
         examples:
           - input: "Example input"
             output: "Expected output"
         metadata:
           priority: [low|medium|high]
           version: 1.0
         </rule>
         ```

      4. Best Practices:
         - Keep rules focused and single-purpose
         - Include clear examples
         - Document the rule's intent
         - Use clear, specific patterns
         - Test rules before committing

examples:
  - input: |
      # Bad: Creating rule in wrong location
      /rules/new-rule.mdc
      new-rule.mdc

      # Good: Creating rule in correct location
      .cursor/rules/new-rule.mdc
    output: "Rule file created in correct location with proper structure"

metadata:
  priority: high
  version: 1.0
</rule>
