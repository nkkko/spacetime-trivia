      When implementing solutions or debugging issues:

      1. Check the llms/spacetime-docs.txt file for relevant context:
         ```
         llms/
         └── spacetime-docs.txt  # Contains important documentation and context
         ```

      2. Key areas to review:
         - Implementation guidelines
         - Known issues and solutions
         - Best practices
         - Common pitfalls
         - Architecture decisions

      3. Use this documentation to:
         - Understand existing patterns
         - Follow established conventions
         - Learn from previous solutions
         - Avoid repeating known issues

      4. Consider updating the documentation if:
         - You discover new solutions
         - You encounter undocumented issues
         - You implement new patterns
         - You make architectural decisions

examples:
  - input: |
      # When encountering errors or implementing features
      Error: Failed to process request
      TODO: Implement new feature
    output: "Check llms/spacetime-docs.txt for relevant context and solutions"
