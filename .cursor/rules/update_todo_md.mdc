      To update TODO.md after a task is completed:

      1. **Identify the Task Line**: Locate the exact line in `TODO.md` that corresponds to the completed task.
         Example task line:
         `- [ ] [P1] Implement feature X (@username) #category`

      2. **Mark as Complete**: Change the `[ ]` (incomplete) marker to `[x]` (complete).
         Updated task line:
         `- [x] [P1] Implement feature X (@username) #category`

      3. **Verify**: Ensure no other parts of the line (priority, description, owner, tags) are accidentally altered unless intended.

      If you want me to attempt this change, please confirm the exact task description from `TODO.md` that you wish to mark as complete.
      For example: "Mark '[P1] Implement feature X (@username) #category' as complete in TODO.md"
</rule>

## Example Usage (Informational)

This rule helps ensure `TODO.md` stays up-to-date. When you tell the AI assistant that a task is done, and you have `TODO.md` in context or mention it, this rule should remind the AI (or you) of the correct procedure to update the file.

If the AI is to make the edit, it will need to be very precise about which line to change.
